This dashboard was created as an evolution of the final project of my Programming Logic class at PUCRS.

It was created to learn new Python libraries for generating user interfaces. I used Plotly's Dash and DBC to create the layouts and Dash to create callbacks to the "server", so that the content could be dynamically generated.

For manipulating the data, I used Pandas. Graphs were generated using Plotly Express.
