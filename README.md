# WeatherApp
This Web App Dashboard was created as an evolution of the final project of my Programming Logic class at PUCRS.

It was created to learn new Python libraries for generating user interfaces. I used Plotly's Dash and DBC to create the layouts and Dash to create callbacks to the "server", so that the content could be dynamically generated.

For manipulating the data, I used Pandas. Graphs were generated using Plotly Express.

To run the web application, download the files, run them locally in a virtual environment, and access the application through the assigned port in a web browser.

*Make sure all the used libraries are installed and updated to their latest version.
Libraries and methods used:
dash (dash_trable, dcc, Input, Output, State, callback, and exceptions), plotly (express and graph_objects), pandas, dash-bootstrap-components
